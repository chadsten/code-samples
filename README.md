# code-samples
Just some code samples of neat things I can show off.

None of these are complete works due to confidentiality or practicality of showcasing the entire application. 

Also see https://github.com/chadsten/advent-of-code for a laugh at me learning Python. It feels a lot like R so it wasn't too bad once I got into it. Unlearning terrible PHP habits has been loads of fun.
